This application consumes two APIs.
1. [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/current)  API provides conversion of address to latitude and longitude.
2. [mapbox.com](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding) API provides weather forecast for given latitude longitude.

You can sign up for a free account with limited request numbers to try this application.

Once you have the API keys for both, rename the .env-sample to .env file and add these API keys there.
